# Linum labs Audit Assignment

## Instructions

Clone this repo into one of your own private repo's. You need to add the reviewer @GarethJamesLarkan to your repo for reviewing. Once you have set up your repo, install all dependencies. This should be as easy as running

```forge install```

For each issue found during your audit, create an issue in the github repo with a detailed explanation of the issue found as well as whether you would flag it as Critical, High, Medium, Low or Informational. The issues will be reviewed by your reviewers.

You DO NOT need to write a POC for the bugs.

## System Design

For an overview of the system you will be auditing, view the README file in the src folder.
